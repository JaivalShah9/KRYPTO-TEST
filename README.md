# KRYPTO-TEST


I have created an e-commerce websuite for laptop-accesories specific to gaming.

I havent used bootstrap/bulkma,etc.

The application has a login/signup slide page

Then is the landing page where you can tap on an image and it will take you to the item

Next we have a catalogue page with information about the product

Next is add to cart, the cart and payment pages which redirect you to different payment methods.

"If I had the liberty of time id make it more functional, add more uniformity to the webpages(buttons,nav,bar,texts,colours,etc
Then id apply APIs and connect payment methods as for now they arent functional."

The whole code was written from scratch and nothing has been copied from anywhere due to time contraints i had only 2 hours to work on this and I could surely do better

Thank you.
